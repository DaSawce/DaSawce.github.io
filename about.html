            <p1 class="about">I was just a kid when I started fiddling with computers. Not in a sense of changing mechanical hardware at the age of 6, but more so playing video games on Facebook at the time. Growing up, I never knew that I would be in this industry, but the youtube videos of someone making cool designs with simple lines of code and the classes during high school where we had to make a simple game using sprites helped influence where I wanted to be today.

               <br><br> Despite the challenges that come with working in this field, I can say that itâ€™s been a headachingely fulfilling journey.I aspire to be better, I aspire to be stronger, and I aspire for the little me to look forward to what I will achieve, by just being me. My aspiration is not just personal growth; it's also about paving the way for the little me to marvel at what lies ahead.
